/*Code by Savannah Smalley
 * Made 2/28/21
 * Last Edited 3/1/21
 * Hawaiian Pronunciation V.2.
 * 
 * This is version 2 of my attempt at the Hawaiian Code Challenge. The first code contained a massive while loop full of switch case statements 
 * and was not able to print "invalid" as a response properly.
 * 
 * This version will focus on being less redundant and more on string manipulation.
 */

import java.util.Scanner;

//imported scanner utility so the code could receive user input

/*Things carried over from version 1: 
 * 
 * Using a while loop to let the user decide if they want to enter another word. 
 * 
 * Recognizing the userinput as a String named "hawaiian".
